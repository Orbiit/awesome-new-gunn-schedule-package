no idea how to do tests lol

[scratch](https://github.com/LLK/scratch-vm/tree/develop/test) organizes them into

`fixtures` - probably contains files and helper functions to create things for tests

`integration` - multiple parts working together

`unit` - tests each method with various arguments. generally it seems they don't test edge cases, eg what happens if you give a basketball to a `tan` function

i'll copy! because idk how else to do lol. called learneances

how does mocha make testing *fun*
